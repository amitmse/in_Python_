Covariance:
	- It refers to the measure of how two variables will change (directional relationship) when they are compared to each other
	- It measures the Variance between two variables

Z-test:
	The sample is assumed to be normally distributed. A z-score is calculated with population parameters such as "population mean" 
	and "population standard deviation" and is used to validate a hypothesis that the sample drawn belongs to the same population. 
	Sample mean is same as the population mean.

t /Student  Distribution:
	- The t test tells how significant the differences between groups are. A t-test is used to compare the mean of 
	  two given samples.
	- A t-test is used when the population mean and population standard deviation are unknown.
	- Independent samples t-test which compares mean for two groups. t test for equality of population mean when variance is same.
	  Before t test, F test is required for equality for variance.
	- One sample t-test which tests the mean of a single group against a known mean.
	- Test the significance of regression coefficient. 
	- Example:
		A very simple example: Let’s say you have a cold and you try a naturopathic remedy. Your cold lasts a couple of days.
		The next time you have a cold, you buy an over-the-counter pharmaceutical and the cold lasts a week. You survey your
		friends and they all tell you that their colds were of a shorter duration (an average of 3 days) when they took the
		homeopathic remedy. What you really want to know is, are these results repeatable? A t test can tell you by comparing
		the means of the two groups and letting you know the probability of those results happening by chance.
	
	- Paired sample t-test which compares means from the same group at different times. Choose the paired t-test if you have 
	  two measurements on the same item, person or thing

ANOVA:
	Known as analysis of variance, is used to compare multiple (three or more) samples with a single test 
	i.e. all sample means are equal
	
Chi-Squared Distribution :
	- Tests for the strength of the association between two categorical variables. Chi Square lets you know whether 
	  two groups have significantly different opinions, which makes it a very useful statistic for survey research.
	- Population mean is known and test the variance of normal distributed. chi squared distribution is the square 
	  of a normal distribution.
	- The chi-squared distribution is used primarily in hypothesis testing:
		- Goodness of fit test, which determines if a sample matches the population 
			(does a coin tossed 20 times turn up 10 heads and 10 tails?)
		- A chi-square fit test for two independent variables is used to compare two variables in a contingency table 
			to check if the data fits
		- Chi-squared test of independence in contingency tables (is there a relationship between gender and salary?)
		- Likelihood-ratio test for nested models
		- Log-rank test in survival analysis
		- Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test for stratified contingency tables

Likelihood-ratio :
	This test assesses the goodness of fit of two competing statistical models based on the ratio of their likelihoods
	
F-test:
	- F-test of equality of variances is a test for the null hypothesis that two normal populations have the same variance. 
	
	- It is most often used when comparing statistical models that have been fitted to a data set, in order to identify
	  the model that best fits the population from which the data were sampled. "F-tests" mainly arise when the models
	  have been fitted to the data using least squares.
