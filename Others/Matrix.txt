Matrix

Diagonal:
	- Square 
	- Non zero elements in diagonal
	
Identity:
	- Square
	- One in diagonal 
	- A * Inverse A is equal to Identity
	- AI = A = IA

Singular:
	- Determinant = 0
	- Square
	- Inverse is undefined when determinant equal 0 [If two lines have same slope then they'll never intersect, so no unique solution]

Transpose:
	- Transpose[Transpose A] 	= A
	- Transpose[AB] 			= Transpose[B] Transpose[A]
	- Transpose[A+B] 			= Transpose[A] + Transpose[B]
	
Symmetric: 
	- Square matrix 
	- Equal to its own transpose
	
Skew Symmetric:
	- Its a square matrix whose transpose equals its negative
	
Trace:
	- Sum of diagonal elements in the matrix. Determinant is like the trace operator without parentheses.
	- Trace[A] 		= Trace[Transpose A]
	- Trace[AB] 	= Trace[BA]
	- Trace[A+B] 	= Trace[A] + Trace[B]
	

Norms:
	- A norm of a vector is informally measure of the length of the vector.
	- 

Orthogonal:
	- Square matrix 
	- An orthogonal matrix is always a symmetric matrix.
	- Columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors
	- A matrix is orthogonal if its transpose is equal to its inverse
	- The determinant of any orthogonal matrix is either +1 or -1.
	- Every identity matrix is an orthogonal matrix.
	- The diagonal matrix is an orthogonal one.

Hessian:
	- Square matrix
	- Second-order partial derivatives
	- The Hessian matrix of a convex function is positive semi-definite. 
	
Regression with Matrix Algebra: http://faculty.cas.usf.edu/mbrannick/regression/regma.htm
	y = Xb +e	
	y = Xb
	X'y = X'Xb						[X is square and symmetric matrix]
	(X'X)-1 X'y = (X'X)-1 (X'X)b
	(X'X)-1 X'y=Ib	[identity matrix]
	(X'X)-1 X'y=b
	
	Inverse(A'A)A'A=I 		[If columns are linearly independent then A'A is invertible. Pseudo Inverse : Inverse(A'A)A']
	Equation has a single solution if Transpose(X)*X is invertible(non-singular). If it's not, you have more solutions.
	Full rank or identification condition means that there are no exact linear relationships between the variables.
	X is a full column rank means that the columns of X are linearly independent and that there are at least K observations.
