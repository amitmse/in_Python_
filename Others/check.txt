LGD:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Development Snap			Annual snapshots (Jan'08 - Jan'17)	
- Performance Window			12 Months	
- Default Definition			Charge off, DRP and 90+ DPD	
- Exclusions:
					1. Observation Charge-Off ( Business exclusion, provisioning has been already done)	
					2. Observation DRP ( Part of PL)	
					3. Low balance Default (< 500 MYR)	
					4. Deceased customer 	
					5. Fraud	
					6. Lost Stolen 	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modelling Approach							
1. Valid Base				Valid accounts post exclusion					
2. Identification of PDP		Post Default pathways(PDP) i.e. CO, DRP & Cure					
3. Recovery tracking			Recovery was tracked at an customer level					
4. Flow Rate				Calculate flow rate by PDP					
6. Cyclicity Check			Check relationship between flow rates and MEVs					
7. Identify PIT for LGD estimation	Identify most recent snapshot for LGD model development					
8. Recovery estimation			Fit a logistic function to estimate recovery (data used: time to recovery and recovery)
9. Prediction of LGD 			First Step: Simulate recovery at a range of EIR (10% to 30%) using above logistic function
					Second Step: Fit a linear model to predict LGD using EIR"					
10. Validation of LGD model		Test above model on OOT sample to check the accuracy

Recovery:

	DRP:
		 - Over the time ~60% recovery has been observed. 
		 - Recovery for 2014 is low due to sudden jump in the outstanding at default( shown in chart 2). 
		 - Also 200801 is an exceptional year where there is a spike in recovery at the very first month

	CO:
		- A recovery of ~35% has been observed over 71 months.
		- The difference between before and after 2012 can observed due to DEBT sells.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LGD Model:

	- DRP is not considered as existing defaults as it is a part of IFRS9 PL model. 
	- GD for cure rate is assumed to be zero.
	- Final LGD Equations are Flow Rate adjusted
