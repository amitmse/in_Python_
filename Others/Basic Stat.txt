Z-test:
	The sample is assumed to be normally distributed. A z-score is calculated with population parameters such as "population mean" 
	and "population standard deviation" and is used to 
	validate a hypothesis that the sample drawn belongs to the same population. 
	Sample mean is same as the population mean


Chi-Squared Distribution :
		chi squared distribution is the square of a normal distribution.
		Chi Square lets you know whether two groups have significantly different opinions, 
			which makes it a very useful statistic for survey research.
		
		The chi-squared distribution is used primarily in hypothesis testing:
				- 	Chi-squared test of independence in contingency tables								(is there a relationship between gender and salary?)
				-	Chi-squared test of goodness of fit of observed data to hypothetical distributions 	
						(does a coin tossed 20 times turn up 10 heads and 10 tails?) 
				-	Likelihood-ratio test for nested models
				-	Log-rank test in survival analysis
				-	Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test for stratified contingency tables
