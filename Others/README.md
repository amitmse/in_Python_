# Type of data:
## Nominal / categorical/qualitative /non-parametric:  
- Example: colour,gender. 
- Check: frequency each category. 
- Test: Comparison/Difference: 
	- Test for proportion (for one categorical variable)
	- Difference of two proportions
	- Chi-Square test for independence (for two categorical variables)
	- Relationship: Chi-Square test for independence

## Ordinal : Similar as Nominal
- Example: rank, satisfaction.  
- Check: frequency or mean (special case). 
- Test: Similar as Nominal

## Interval / Ratio / quantitative/continuous  : 
- Example: number of customers, income,age. 
- Check: Mean ..
- Test:	Comparison/Difference:
	- Test for a mean / T test (for one continuous variable)
	- Difference of two means (independent samples)
	- Difference of two means(paired T test. Pre and Post scenario)
	- Relationship: Regression Analysis / Correlation (for two continuous variables/for relationship)

# Statistical tests : 

## T Test
- Compares mean for two groups
- Test the significance of regression coefficient

## Chi-Squared Test:
- Goodness of fit
- Test of independence
- Likelihood-ratio test for nested models

## F Test:
- Equality of variances

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Covariance:
- It refers to the measure of how two variables will change (directional relationship) when they are compared to each other
- It measures the Variance between two variables
- Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables. Correlation on the other hand measures 
   both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Correlation vs Regression:
### Correlation: 
- It measures the degree of relationship between two variables. 
- correlation doesn’t capture causality.
- Correlation between x and y is the same as the one between y and x.
### Regression analysis:
- It is about how one variable affects another or what changes it triggers in the other.
- Regression is based on causality (cause and effect).
- Regression of x and y, and y and x, yields completely different results.

# To create Table in GITHUB:

You can create tables with pipes | and hyphens -. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column. You must include a blank line before your table in order for it to correctly render.

			 
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

The pipes on either end of the table are optional.

Cells can vary in width and do not need to be perfectly aligned within columns. There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row.


You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by including colons : to the left, right, or on both sides of the hyphens within the header row.

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |


It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/807820-a-scrupulous-writer-in-every-sentence-that-he-writes-will

“A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus:

1. What am I trying to say?
2. What words will express it?
3. What image or idiom will make it clearer?
4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?

And he will probably ask himself two more:

1. Could I put it more shortly?
2. Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?
