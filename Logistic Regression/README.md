Logistic Regression : https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/logistic-regression-algorithm-step-amit-kumar/

Logistic regression assumptions: 		(http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/soc512LogisticNotes.pdf)
		1. Dependent variable should be binary
		2. Linearity between independent & log odds (non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables)
		3. Independence of errors
		4. No perfect multicollinearity
    
Because logistic regression uses MLE rather than OLS, it avoids many of the typical assumptions tested in statistical analysis:
	- Does not assume normality of variables (both DV and IVs).
	-	Does not assume linearity between DV and IVs.
	-	Does not assume homoscedasticity.
	-	Does not assume normal errors.
	- MLE allows more flexibility in the data and analysis because it has fewer restrictions
  
Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): Finds parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): Finds parameter values that minimizing the error
