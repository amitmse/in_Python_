## Charts in Python

https://github.com/amitmse/in_Python_/blob/master/plot/Plot.py

## Matplotlib
	- First Python data visualization library
	- It was designed to closely resemble MATLAB
 	- Some libraries like pandas and Seaborn are “wrappers” over matplotlib
  	- it's not very useful for creating publication-quality charts quickly and easily

 
## Seaborn 
	- Seaborn harnesses the power of matplotlib
 	- The key difference is Seaborn's default styles and color palettes



## Plotnine / ggplot
	- Plotnine is a python implementation of ggplot2, an R plotting system
 	- Plotnine is tightly integrated with pandas


## Bokeh
	- Like ggplot, Bokeh is based on The Grammar of Graphics
 	- Its strength lies in the ability to create interactive, web-ready plots



## Plotly
	- Like Bokeh, Plotly’s strength lies in making interactive plots
 	- Plotly as one of the best data visualization tools


## Pygal
	- Pygal, like Plotly and Bokeh, offers interactive plots that can be embedded in a web browser. 
    

## Altair
	- Like Seaborn, Altair is a declarative visualization library that allows 
 		you to create aesthetically pleasing graphs & charts
	- Focus on visualization and not on coding.

## Gleam
	- Gleam is inspired by R’s Shiny package.
