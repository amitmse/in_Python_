# Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP- Abstraction : Process happens inside and not visible to public.
                It hides the inner workings of an object when it’s not necessary to see them.

- Encapsulation	: Prevent data modification.
                  This prevent data from direct modification which is called encapsulation. 
                  Represent by prefix i.e single “ _ “ or double “ __“. 
                  It stores related variables and methods within objects and protects them.
                  Encapsulation is one of the ways that object-oriented programming creates abstraction. 
                  A programmer could make a change to the structure or contents of the object without worrying about the public interface.

- Inheritance :	Creating new class (child) using existing class (parent). 
                Inheritance is a way of creating new class for using details of existing class without modifying it. 
                It allows sub-classes to use attributes from parent classes. 
                Instead of creating new classes for everything, programmers can create a base class and then extend it to new sub-classes when they need to.

- Polymorphism :	Allows to define methods in the child class with the same name as defined in the parent class.
                  Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use common interface for multiple form (data types).
                  It allows objects and methods to deal with multiple different situations with a single interface. 
                  Polymorphism is a result of inheritance.

## Charts in Python

https://github.com/amitmse/in_Python_/blob/master/plot/Plot.py

## Matplotlib
	- First Python data visualization library
	- It was designed to closely resemble MATLAB
 	- Some libraries like pandas and Seaborn are “wrappers” over matplotlib
  	- it's not very useful for creating publication-quality charts quickly and easily

 
## Seaborn 
	- Seaborn harnesses the power of matplotlib
 	- The key difference is Seaborn's default styles and color palettes



## Plotnine / ggplot
	- Plotnine is a python implementation of ggplot2, an R plotting system
 	- Plotnine is tightly integrated with pandas


## Bokeh
	- Like ggplot, Bokeh is based on The Grammar of Graphics
 	- Its strength lies in the ability to create interactive, web-ready plots



## Plotly
	- Like Bokeh, Plotly’s strength lies in making interactive plots
 	- Plotly as one of the best data visualization tools


## Pygal
	- Pygal, like Plotly and Bokeh, offers interactive plots that can be embedded in a web browser. 
    

## Altair
	- Like Seaborn, Altair is a declarative visualization library that allows you to create aesthetically pleasing graphs & charts
	- Focus on visualization and not on coding.

## Gleam
	- Gleam is inspired by R’s Shiny package.
