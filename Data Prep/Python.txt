- data scientists use to manage unstructured data. 

Pro:
- Free
- Easy to learn
- Scalability
- Big community
- Good in Machine learning
- Growing
- Fast in adapting new technique
- Data Handling/Big Data
- Visualization 
   In terms of graphical output, Python edges SAS out.  Both are verbose and tedious to get it to work. Python wins because the output is cleaner and there are way more options.
- Python is much a more versatile object oriented language that has capabilities that SAS doesnâ€™t have.  




Cons:
- High cost
- Slow in adapting new technique
