- Abstraction : It hides the inner workings of an object when it’s not necessary to see them. 
                All you need to know is that when you tell the piece to move, it moves.



- Encapsulation	: This prevent data from direct modification which is called encapsulation. 
                  Represent by prefix i.e single “ _ “ or double “ __“. 
                  It stores related variables and methods within objects and protects them.
                  Encapsulation is one of the ways that object-oriented programming creates abstraction. 
                  A programmer could make a change to the structure or contents of the object without worrying about the public interface.



- Inheritance :	Inheritance is a way of creating new class for using details of existing class without modifying it. 
                It allows sub-classes to use attributes from parent classes. 
                Instead of creating new classes for everything, programmers can create a base class and then extend it to new sub-classes when they need to.



- Polymorphism :	Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use common interface for multiple form (data types).
                  It allows objects and methods to deal with multiple different situations with a single interface. 
                  Polymorphism is a result of inheritance.
